Gesture Recognition

To run, open the App-build directory and type- 
sh build_all.sh

For changing the filters, Open Summer proj/Video Feed
Type g++ video_filter_hsv.cpp `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs` -o video_filter
Then run with ./video_filter
After obtaining the values, change the corresponding ones (#define FILTER1 etc) in App build/2_color.cpp and gest-record.cpp

Execute the build_all and the new filters will be implmented. A program will be added soon so it need not be done manually.
